We are an independent fork that promises upkeep in following the [main repository](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecs) .

## What's different?

Everything, basically.

- Full English Microsoft DocsFX documentation (Translated from Russian and maticulously edited, XML commented, and cleaned up).
- All extension plugins combined into one so you get the full featureset of ``LeoEcs-lite`` without having to do all the manual work
- Code optimized and stripped, with Unity dependencies removed so you can use it anywhere!
- Refactored for .NET Core 3.1 which makes it fully cross platform / agnostic / GAC independent when statically built.
- Intense code optimization and refactoring that speeds up the performance of the original project by taking advantage of modern compiler features, without losing stability or the intent of the original work.
