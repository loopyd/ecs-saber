[![Release Build](https://github.com/loopyd/ecs-saber/actions/workflows/onpush_master.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/loopyd/ecs-saber/actions/workflows/onpush_master.yml) [![DocFX Build](https://github.com/loopyd/ecs-saber/actions/workflows/onpush_docfx.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/loopyd/ecs-saber/actions/workflows/onpush_docfx.yml)

We are an independent fork that promises upkeep in following the )[main repository](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecs) .

## What's different?

Everything, basically.

- Full English Microsoft DocsFX documentation (Translated from Russian and maticulously edited, XML commented, and cleaned up).
- All extension plugins combined into one so you get the full featureset of ``LeoEcs-lite`` without having to do all the manual work
- Code optimized and stripped, with Unity dependencies removed so you can use it anywhere!
- Refactored for .NET Core 3.1 which makes it fully cross platform / agnostic / GAC independent when statically built.
