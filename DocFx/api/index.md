This fork of the project was built with ease of use in mind on top of a tool built by a company that's main objective is ease of use:  Microsoft.  I have implemented this DocsFX page to make real time browsing of the project graphical and easy to understand.  ECS frameworks are complicated things, and I believe this documentation tool baked right into the solution files helps open the gateway to those who wish to learn more about how this particular ECS framework works.  Any time I make a change to functionality in code, that change will reflect here when I update the repository.

## Why I did this

Language was not simply the only barrier I had to overcome when stripping out, combining the modules of, and producing automatic documention for the original LeoECS Framework.  It is classically one of the most difficult to use for .NET based upon its lack of consistant up-to-date documentation alone, and all of the video footage showing it is not in a commonly accessable language to anyone outside of the country where it was born -- Russia.  LeoECS is the most performant ECS framework that you can get on C-Sharp, but its not easy for everyone to access.  This project changes that level of accessability to appeal to more people and takes the code spaghetti out of the equation with clear and concise XML doctags this website uses to generate its content in the code.
